# World_Weather_Analysis

##Overview

This scope of this project is to further develop the PlanMyTrip app to include a weather description when searching for travel destinations. Using the markers shown on the map, testers were able to identify four potential travel destinations and hotels based on weather preferences. Furthermore, they were able to create a Google Maps travel itinerary of the four cities chosen.
